# Reel Time Filter Designer
## Introduction:
Real Time Filter Designer is a desktop application designed to facilitate the design and implementation of custom digital filters in real-time. The software allows users to design filters by placing zeros and poles on the z-plane, visualize the corresponding frequency response, apply the filter to real-time signals, and correct for phase distortion using All-Pass filters.

# Key Features:
* Z-Plane Plot:
  * Interactive plot for placing zeros and poles on the z-plane.
  * Modify zeros/poles by dragging them.
  * Delete individual zeros or poles.
  * Clear all zeros, all poles, or all elements.
* Frequency Response Visualization: Graphs showing magnitude and phase response of the designed filter.
* Real-time Filtering:
  * Apply the designed filter to a lengthy signal in real-time.
  * Graphs showing the time progress of the input and filtered signals.
  * Control the speed/temporal-resolution of the filtering process using a slider.
  * Input real-time signal via mouse movement with speed-based frequency generation.
* Phase Correction with All-Pass Filters:
  * Library of All-Pass filters for visualizing zero-pole combinations and phase response.
  * Option to add one or more All-Pass filters to the original filter design.
  * Custom-built All-Pass filter functionality for user-defined phase correction.
  * Enable/disable added All-Pass elements via drop-menu or checkboxes group.
